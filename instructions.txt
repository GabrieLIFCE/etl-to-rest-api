# Open terminal in the base folder directory

# Install the dependencies present on the file requirements.txt on base folder (you may want to create a venv before)
    - pip install -r requirements.txt

# Execute the main.py file
    - python main.py

main.py will call the methods to extract and populate sqlite database, then it will
run the api.

The database (database.sqlite) will contain 3 tables:
 - cve
 - cpe
 - cvssv3

You can access/query the tables using a database administration tool, such as Dbeaver. 
There you can also see the ER diagram of the tables.
